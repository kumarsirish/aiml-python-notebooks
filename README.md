✅ Supervised Learning

(Uses labeled data: input X + target y)

These algorithms learn a mapping from features to known labels.
Decision Tree 
k-Nearest Neighbours (k-NN) 
Logistic Regression 
Polynomial Regression (still regression, just nonlinear features)

✅ Unsupervised Learning
(No labels; discovers structure in data)
k-Means 
Hierarchical Clustering
